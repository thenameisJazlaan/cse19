      Google was founded on September 4, 1998, by American computer scientists
      Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Together, they own about 14% of its publicly
      listed shares and control 56% of its stockholder voting power through
      super-voting stock. The company went public via an initial public offering
      (IPO) in 2004. In 2015, Google was reorganized as a wholly owned
      subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. Google is Alphabet's largest subsidiary and is
